 # you make the program for taking average.
# input a number n frm user and then take n inputs (use for loop for n inputs) and 
# then print the average of those n numbers.
# i'll tell you what the function should take..
# it should take num as argument and rest, it should input all other numbers on its own
# i.e. inside the function. then return the average!! okay


# chalo give i m ready
# your task is to hack facebook using python program. you have to use sockets module for that
# okay?  how?????? but this sounds amazingggg
# what is sockets?? its a library for networking. i one made a multiplayer shooter using it.
# very nice module.
# i m not understanding anything..?? aare, u have used random module right? yes
# you import it and start using its functions. similarly, is the sockets module.
# you use it to connect two or more than two computers on a network, together,
# so that you can control another pc, share files, send data, etc..
# ok
# ok ,ye toh saab mazak tha, but our next progra would be to convert decimal to binary...
# wait but kya upar wala possible . nope! really
# u were joking?? aur kkya, maine khud facebok hack nahi kiya, mai th kya bade bade log bhi 
# nahi kar sakte...mark zukerburg khud nahi karsakta facebook hack ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
# ğŸ˜‘ğŸ˜‘ itni raat ko itna bda joke

# binary to decimal is our next program, not to hack facebook!
# fine
# type python in terminal why kar toh sahi, facebook hack karengeğŸ˜‚ krr dia...ab? enter
# tell me the binary of 25 (0010 0101, not with bsd, simple con)version
# (11001) 
# type bin(25) and hit enter
# python already has builtin fucntionality for dec to binary.
# but not for bin to decimal. got it? yes
# r u there?
